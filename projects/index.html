					<TD><p><em>In neuroscience, it is very common to observe a population of functional connectivity networks changing over time. 
In this research, we are motivated by the EEG connectivity data obtained in the working memory study --- each network and its temporal changes represent the brain activity when a human subject is conducting certain cognitive task. Therefore, the data contains rich information about the potential mechanism of work memory. In particular, it is of high scientific value to learn which broad regions of brain are most responsible for those tasks, and how individuals vary on those regions due to different memory capacity. To address this need while flexibly accommodate the uncertainty, we consider an empirical Bayes method, combining a multi-scale decomposition of the average connectivity matrix and a flexible mixed-effect Bayesian model given the decomposition. To learn the multi-level brain structure, we develop a new symmetric matrix decomposition, named Treed-SVD, that produces a set of basis according to binary-tree partition of the nodes, while keeping those vectors orthogonal to minimize overlaps between levels. Given this common structure, we let each network have its own weights on those vectors (varying over individuals, time points and tasks) --- this reduces to a very scalable logistic regression, but characterizes the importance of brain regions at different levels, together with the individual variation. </em></br></p></TD>
