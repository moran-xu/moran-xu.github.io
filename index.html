			Welcome to Maoran Xu's webpage! I am an Assistant Professor in Statistics at Indiana University Bloomington. I work on flexible probabilistic models for inferring low-dimensional structures in high-dimensional and structured data. Previously, I obtained my doctoral degree in statistics under the supervision of Dr. Leo Duan and worked as a postdoctoral researcher with Drs. Amy Herring and David Dunson.
        </p>
		<p>
			My research is mainly about inference and uncertainty quantification for various types of data and models. For example, high-dimensional data, network data, latent variable models, and cluster models. Specifically, I am interested in using optimization tools in Bayesian methods to build new likelihood-based models on low-dimensional geometric spaces.
